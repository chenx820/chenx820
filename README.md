## About MeÂ 
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Chen, a physics major student at Imperial College London. 


I am passionate about exploring the fascinating realms of **Quantum Computing** and **Quantum Information**. My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in physics, and I am enthusiastic about applying this knowledge to cutting-edge research in quantum technologies.


## Research Interests and ExperienceÂ 
- **Quantum Computing:**Â 
  - **Trapped Ion Systems:**  Previously engaged in research involving the calibration of experimental parameters in trapped-ion quantum computers. This work has resulted in three patents:

      - ([CN117371547](https://patents.google.com/patent/CN117371547/en)) Ion trap chip parameter determining method and device, electronic equipment and medium _(Application Granted)_

      - ([CN117454997](https://patents.google.com/patent/CN117454997/en)) Ion trap chip parameter correction method and device, electronic equipment and medium

      - ([CN117494829](https://patents.google.com/patent/CN117494829/en)) Ion trap chip parameter calibration method and device, electronic equipment and medium

  - **Rydberg Atom systems:** Designed and improved compilation strategies, optimizing the compilation procedure, enhancing efficiency and reducing decoherence in Rydberg atom systems.

  - **Semiconductor Quantum Dots:** Focused on experimental work. 




## Goals and AspirationsÂ 
I am always on the lookout for new opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether itâ€™s through collaborative projects, internships, or further academic research, I am eager to connect with like-minded individuals and organizations. If you believe we could collaborate effectively, please do not hesitate to reach out! ðŸ“§
