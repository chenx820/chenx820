# Chen Huang
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Chen, a physics major student at Imperial College London. 

## About Me
I am passionate about exploring the fascinating realms of **Quantum Computing** and **Quantum Information**. My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in physics, and I am enthusiastic about applying this knowledge to cutting-edge research in quantum technologies.

## Research Interests
- **Quantum Computing:**
  - **Trapped Ion Systems:**  Previously engaged in research involving the calibration of experimental parameters in trapped ion quantum computers. This work has resulted in three patents:
      - ([CN117371547A](https://patents.google.com/patent/CN117371547A/en?oq=CN117371547A)) Ion trap chip parameter determining method and device, electronic equipment and medium
      - ([CN117454997A](https://patents.google.com/patent/CN117454997A/en?oq=CN117454997A)) Ion trap chip parameter correction method and device, electronic equipment and medium
      - ([CN117494829A](https://patents.google.com/patent/CN117494829A/en?oq=CN117494829A))Ion trap chip parameter calibration method and device, electronic equipment and medium
  - **Rydberg Atom systems**
  - **Semiconductor Qubits**

## Goals and Aspirations
I am always on the lookout for new opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether itâ€™s through collaborative projects, internships, or further academic research, I am eager to connect with like-minded individuals and organizations. If you believe we could collaborate effectively, please do not hesitate to reach out!
